# CachyOS CLI Installer Build Troubleshooting Prompt

## Previous Build Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Compiler/Linker Configuration
- **Problem**: The fmt and ftxui subprojects were not being compiled with libc++ flags when using Clang
- **Fix**: Modified meson.build files in these subprojects to add libc++ compiler flags
  - Added `-stdlib=libc++` and `-fstrict-vtable-pointers` to fmt_private_cpp_args and fmt_interface_cpp_args
  - Added similar flags to ftxui's meson.build file for its libraries

### Issue 2: Runtime Library Dependencies
- **Problem**: Version mismatches between build and runtime environments for:
  - libunwind.so.1 (system had libunwind.so.8)
  - libc++.so.1
  - libc++abi.so.1
- **Fix**: Created symbolic links to make newer libraries available at the expected paths
  - Created symlink from libunwind.so.8 to libunwind.so.1

## Current Build Failure Investigation

Please check the following:

1. **Did the meson.build modifications persist?**
   - Verify that subprojects/fmt/meson.build and subprojects/ftxui/meson.build still have the libc++ flags
   - Check if any git operations or subproject updates have reverted these changes

2. **Are there new subprojects that need similar compiler flag modifications?**
   - Review build_log.txt for new linker errors involving other dependencies
   - Look for error patterns similar to the previous issues with fmt and ftxui

3. **Are the library symbolic links still intact?**
   - Check if libunwind.so.1 symlink still exists
   - Verify any other symlinks created for libc++.so.1 and libc++abi.so.1

4. **Docker build environment consistency**
   - Confirm the Docker image (eef56869a417) hasn't changed
   - Verify that libc++-18-dev and libc++abi-18-dev are being installed correctly

5. **Library version changes**
   - Check if system libraries have been updated since the last successful build
   - Run `ldd build/cachyos-installer` to identify any missing or incorrect libraries

## Specific Actions to Try

1. Rebuild with verbose output to see exact linking commands and errors:
   ```
   docker run --rm -v /home/dem0n/Projects/new-cli-installer:/app -w /app eef56869a417 sh -x -c "{ apt-get update && apt-get install -y pkg-config libcurl4-openssl-dev libc++-18-dev libc++abi-18-dev && rm -rf build && meson setup build --verbose && meson compile -C build -v && meson test -C build; } > /app/verbose_build_log.txt 2>&1"
   ```

2. If the build succeeds inside Docker but fails to run on the host:
   ```
   # Check for missing libraries
   ldd build/cachyos-installer
   
   # Create/update symlinks if needed
   sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/libunwind.so.8 /usr/lib/libunwind.so.1
   # Add any other required symlinks identified by ldd
   ```

3. Check for C++ standard library conflicts:
   ```
   # Inside Docker container
   docker run --rm -v /home/dem0n/Projects/new-cli-installer:/app -w /app eef56869a417 bash -c "cd build && clang++ -print-search-dirs"
   ```
