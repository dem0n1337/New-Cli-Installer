## Key Files Modified

The following source files were modified to fix the RAID and LVM compatibility issues:

1. `src/tui.cpp`
   - Fixed syntax errors in RAID creation commands
   - Added RAID detection when creating LVM on RAID arrays
   - Improved error handling and logging

2. `src/utils.cpp`
   - Added RAID modules to initramfs
   - Added diagnostic logging for RAID+LVM configurations
   - Ensured mdadm.conf is copied to the installed system

3. `src/config.cpp`
   - Added RAID configuration flag

## Problem Summary

The CLI installer had several issues with RAID and LVM compatibility:

1. Syntax errors in RAID creation commands
2. Missing RAID detection in configuration
3. Missing RAID modules in initramfs
4. Incomplete error handling for RAID+LVM operations

## Solution Summary

The following changes were made to address these issues:

1. Fixed syntax errors in the RAID creation code
2. Added proper RAID detection and configuration
3. Added RAID module loading in initramfs
4. Added comprehensive logging
5. Enhanced error handling

## Next Steps

1. Review the [Implementation Plan](raid_lvm_implementation_plan.md) for a roadmap of next steps
2. Run the [Automated Test Script](../tests/raid_lvm_test.sh) to verify basic functionality
3. Follow the [Testing Plan](../tests/testing_plan.md) for comprehensive testing

## Conclusion

This documentation set provides a complete reference for understanding, implementing, and testing the RAID and LVM compatibility fixes. By following the guidance in these documents, you can ensure that the CLI installer properly supports using RAID arrays with LVM.
