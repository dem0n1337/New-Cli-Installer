# Testing Plan for RAID and LVM Compatibility

## Testing Environment Options

For testing RAID and LVM compatibility, we have several options:

### 1. Virtual Machine (VM)
- **Pros**: Full system isolation, can test the entire installer process
- **Cons**: Resource-intensive, takes longer to set up
- **Recommendation**: Good for final verification but overkill for initial testing

### 2. Docker Container
- **Pros**: Lightweight, quick to start
- **Cons**: Limited for testing disk operations, may not fully simulate RAID/LVM
- **Recommendation**: Not ideal for this specific testing need

### 3. Loop Device Testing (Recommended)
- **Pros**: Lightweight, focuses specifically on RAID/LVM functionality
- **Cons**: Doesn't test the full installer integration
- **Recommendation**: Best for initial verification of our code changes

## Recommended Testing Approach

I recommend a two-phase testing approach:

### Phase 1: Loop Device Testing
Use the `raid_lvm_test.sh` script we've already created to test basic RAID and LVM functionality with loop devices. This script:
- Creates virtual disk files
- Sets up a RAID array
- Creates LVM on top of the RAID array
- Tests filesystem operations

This approach allows us to verify that the core RAID and LVM operations work correctly without needing a full VM.

### Phase 2: Build and Test in a Clean Environment
Once the basic functionality is verified, build the installer and test it in a clean environment:

1. **Build the installer**:
   ```bash
   meson setup builddir
   ninja -C builddir
   ```

2. **Test in a minimal VM**:
   - Use QEMU with a minimal disk image
   - Run the installer with focus on RAID and LVM operations
   - Verify that the system boots correctly after installation

## Code Changes Summary

The changes we've made to fix RAID and LVM compatibility include:

1. Fixed syntax errors in RAID creation commands
2. Added RAID detection in configuration
3. Added RAID modules in initramfs
4. Improved error handling for RAID+LVM operations
5. Added diagnostic logging

These changes should ensure that:
- RAID arrays can be properly used as physical volumes for LVM
- The system can boot properly when using both RAID and LVM together
- The installer correctly configures the initramfs with necessary modules

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] RAID array creation works correctly
- [ ] LVM can use RAID arrays as physical volumes
- [ ] Proper modules are added to initramfs
- [ ] System boots correctly with RAID+LVM configuration
- [ ] Error handling works correctly for edge cases
